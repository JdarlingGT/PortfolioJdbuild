Here are three new content sections designed to make your portfolio an even more impressive and comprehensive experience for hiring managers and marketing leaders.

1. New Section: "My Philosophy" (The "Why" Behind Your Work)
This content adds a powerful layer of personal branding and thought leadership. It shows you're not just a technician but a strategist with a clear point of view.

Recommendation: Add this as a new section on your About Page, right after the main introduction.

Content: My Philosophy
My approach to marketing is guided by a simple but powerful belief: Strategy without architecture is a daydream; architecture without strategy is a machine with no purpose. A beautiful brand campaign is meaningless if the technical funnel leaks at every step. Likewise, a perfect CRM automation is useless if it delivers an uninspired message.

I operate on three core principles:

Build for the System, Not Just the Campaign. I view marketing as an interconnected ecosystem. Every component—from a single ad to a complex email workflow—is designed to work in concert with the whole. This ensures scalability, prevents data silos, and creates a seamless customer experience.

Translate Complexity into Clarity. My role is to be the bridge between the creative and the technical. I take complex business goals and translate them into functional requirements for developers, and I explain technical limitations and possibilities in a way that marketing teams can understand and act on.

Measure What Matters, Automate the Rest. I believe in ruthless prioritization. We identify the key performance indicators that truly drive growth and build analytics systems to track them with precision. Everything else—the repetitive tasks, the manual data entry, the routine follow-ups—should be automated to free up human creativity for higher-level thinking.

2. New Page: "Interactive Demos & Labs"
This is a game-changer that few portfolios have. Instead of just describing your work, you're letting potential employers experience it. This section would house interactive demonstrations of the systems you build.

Recommendation: Create a new page in the main navigation called "Interactive Demos."

Content for the "Interactive Demos" Page
Headline: From Theory to Practice: An Interactive Look at My Work
Sub-headline: Explore these interactive demos to see firsthand how I architect marketing systems that are both intelligent and effective.
Demo 1: Marketing Automation Simulator
Description: "Ever wonder how a lead-nurturing system works behind the scenes? This interactive simulator lets you walk through a real-world automation I built. Fill out the mock form and see how the system responds with different email paths and CRM tags based on your choices. This demonstrates my expertise in lifecycle marketing, conditional logic, and CRM architecture."

Interactive Element: A simple form (like a mock "Request a Whitepaper" form) that, upon submission, visually shows a flowchart of the automation logic being triggered (e.g., "Tag Added: interest_in_x," "User entered Nurture Sequence A," "Alert sent to sales team.").

Demo 2: The Graston Technique® Instructor Dashboard
Description: "One of the key challenges for Graston Technique® was providing their instructors with real-time data on event registrations and sales. I built a custom dashboard to solve this. This demo is a sandboxed, read-only version of that dashboard, populated with sample data. Use the filters to explore how instructors can easily access the information they need."

Interactive Element: An embedded, interactive dashboard (you could use a tool like Tableau Public, or build a simple React component) that showcases the filtering and data visualization capabilities you described, such as filtering events by type and seeing instrument purchase
