Please act as an expert UX/UI designer and front-end developer. Based on my previous instructions to build out the content, I now want you to apply a specific design system and structure to the entire Gatsby portfolio. The goal is to create a visually impressive, modern, and professional site that reflects the aesthetic of the design inspiration images I've provided.

Overall Design Philosophy:
The design should be clean, minimalist, and content-focused. We will use a strong typographic hierarchy, generous white space, and a refined color palette to create a sense of authority and sophistication. The feel should be less like a typical developer's portfolio and more like a high-end digital consultant's website.

Step 1: Global Styles & Design System
Please update the global styles and theme configuration (/src/styles/theme.js and /src/styles/variables.js) to implement the following design system.

A. Color Palette:

Primary Accent: A deep, professional blue (e.g., #0A192F). This will be used for headings, links, and primary buttons.

Secondary Accent: A bright, energetic teal or aqua (e.g., #64FFDA). This will be used for highlights, hover effects, and secondary call-to-action elements.

Background: A very light grey or off-white (e.g., #F8F9FA) for the main body background to feel clean but not sterile.

Text (Headings): A dark navy or near-black (e.g., #1D2A3A).

Text (Body): A slightly lighter, softer dark grey (e.g., #8892B0).

Borders/Dividers: A light, subtle grey (e.g., #E2E8F0).

B. Typography:

Headings Font: Use a modern, clean sans-serif font like "Inter" or "Poppins". Headings should be bold (fontWeight: 700) and have tight letter spacing.

Body Font: Use the same font family as the headings but in a regular weight (fontWeight: 400). Ensure the line height is generous (e.g., 1.6) for readability.

Font Sizes (Responsive):

h1 (Page Titles): clamp(40px, 8vw, 80px)

h2 (Section Titles): clamp(32px, 5vw, 50px)

h3 (Card Titles/Subheadings): 22px

Body Text: 18px

Small/Caption Text: 14px

C. Layout & Spacing:

Implement a consistent vertical rhythm and spacing scale based on multiples of 8px (8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, etc.).

Main content sections should have a max-width of 1100px and be centered on the page.

Step 2: Page Structure & Component Styling
Please structure and style the pages and components as follows:

A. Navigation & Header:

The header should be clean and simple. On desktop, it should feature the logo on the left and navigation links (About, Case Studies, Skills, Process, Contact) on the right.

The navigation links should have a subtle hover effect using the secondary accent color.

Make the header "sticky" so it remains at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls, but with a semi-transparent blurred background effect to distinguish it from the content below.

B. Homepage:

Hero Section: The headline should be large and impactful as per the typography rules. The subtext should be clearly secondary. The CTA button should be prominent but clean.

Key Metrics Section: Style this as a four-column grid. Each item should have the large number in the primary accent color and the description in the body text color. Add a subtle border around each grid item.

Featured Case Studies: Display these as large, clean cards with a prominent cover image. On hover, the card should lift slightly (transform: translateY(-5px)) and a semi-transparent overlay with the project title can appear over the image.

C. Case Studies Page (/case-studies):

Start with a clear <h1> page title like "Selected Works."

Display each case study in a full-width section. Alternate the layout for each project:

Project 1: Image on the left, text content (challenge, solution, impact) on the right.

Project 2: Text content on the left, image on the right.

Project 3: Image on the left, text content on the right.

Use clear <h3> tags for "The Challenge," "My Solution," and "The Impact." Use bullet points for the key activities under the solution to make it scannable.

D. Technical Skills Page (/skills):

Structure this page with clear sections using <h2> for "Areas of Expertise" and "Technology Stack."

Technical Spotlights: Style these as distinct "cards" or bordered sections. Use a "Challenge -> Action -> Result" format with clear subheadings. This will break up the text and make the impressive results stand out.

Technology & Software Lists: Display these in a multi-column layout to avoid a long, unappealing list. For example, two or three columns. Use the secondary accent color for bullet points or icons next to each skill.

E. My Process Page (/process):

This page should be highly visual and structured.

Display the four phases as a vertical timeline or a series of numbered, full-width sections.

Use a large, styled number (e.g., "01", "02") for each phase to create a strong visual hierarchy.

Within each phase, use <h3> for the headline and bullet points for the "Key Activities."

F. General Component Styling:

Buttons: Create a primary button style with a solid background of the primary accent color and a secondary (outline) button style with a border of the primary accent color. Both should have a subtle hover transition.

Links: Standard text links should use the primary accent color and have an underline on hover.

Cards: All cards (for projects, skills, etc.) should have a subtle box-shadow and a slight border-radius (e.g., 4px) for a clean, modern look.

Please proceed with implementing this design system across the entire portfolio. The goal is a cohesive, professional, and visually impressive user experience that aligns with the provided inspiration. Let me know if you have any questions.
