 Build a "Project Deep Dives" Section for My Portfolio
Hello! Please act as an expert UX designer and developer. I want to add a new, highly impressive section to my Gatsby portfolio called "Project Deep Dives." The goal of this section is to go beyond typical case studies and create an immersive, educational experience for visitors, particularly hiring managers and marketing leaders.

This section will showcase a collection of in-depth narrative stories that reveal my strategic thinking, technical problem-solving process, and ability to manage complex projects. It needs to be the most compelling and memorable part of the entire portfolio.

Step 1: Create the "Project Deep Dives" Main Page
Please create a new, top-level page at /deep-dives.

Page Title: Project Deep Dives

Headline: From Spark to System: The Stories Behind the Work

Sub-headline: Go beyond the final result. This section offers a transparent, behind-the-scenes look at the strategy, architecture, and problem-solving that goes into building robust, scalable marketing systems.

Layout: This page should serve as a visually engaging hub. Display each "Deep Dive" story as a large, clickable card. Each card should feature:

A unique, bold icon (e.g., 🚀 for "The Launchpad," 🧠 for "The Guardian").

The story's title (e.g., "The Launchpad").

A compelling one-sentence summary (e.g., "Transforming a static directory into an automated revenue engine.").

On hover, the card should have a subtle zoom effect and a soft glow to encourage clicks.

Step 2: Build the Template for Individual Deep Dive Stories
Each story will have its own page. Please create a new Gatsby template for these pages that is designed for long-form, narrative content.

Key Template Features:

Immersive Header: The top of each page should feature a full-width hero section with the story's title and sub-headline in large, impactful typography.

Sticky Table of Contents: As the user scrolls down, a "table of contents" or "story chapters" navigation should appear and stick to the side of the screen (on desktop). This will allow visitors to easily jump between key sections of the story (e.g., "The Spark," "The Blueprint," "The Impact").

Rich Typography: The template should be designed for readability, with generous line spacing, clear headings, and pull quotes to break up the text.

"Key Takeaways" Component: At the end of each story, include a visually distinct "Key Takeaways" box that summarizes the core skills demonstrated in that project (e.g., "Systems Integration," "Product Thinking," "Automation Strategy").

Step 3: Create and Populate the Deep Dive Stories
Please create a new content directory at /content/deep-dives/ and add the following markdown files. For each file, use the template created in Step 2.

A. File: content/deep-dives/the-launchpad.md

Sub-headline: Turning a Certificate into a Live Asset
